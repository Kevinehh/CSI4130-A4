This is Group 13's video submission for our Space Travel Animation. In our scene we have an astronaut who approaches his rocket, takes off into outer space and flies around
celestial bodies to get a closer look at our solar system. A camera follows our main target throughout the animation and the user can activate orbit controls to look around
the solar system. The user can also use the movement keys in the top right legend to fly around the solar system

The astronaut walking was animated using skeletal animation. After he gets into his rocket, the rocket takes off. After loading in a rigged model, various bones were accessed
to imitate a walking animation 

The stars in our solar system were also created using a particle system. For this we used threejs' points system, which is optimized for rendering a large number of small objects

As the rocket gets into high altitude, the user is now in space and can fly closer away from the celestial bodies.
